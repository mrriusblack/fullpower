== Description ==
Duplicate Posts Remover gives you the possibilty of moving to trash the posts and pages with duplicated title.
This plugin has been developed using pure Ajax and offers a friendly user interface to manage post and pages.

1.Download and install the Plugin.

2.It will appear in the sidebar of your wp-admin view, click on it.

3.On the new screen, there is a display that will show you how many total articles you have and how many of them have duplicate titles.

4.Click on Duplicate Content (if the number is over zero).

5.A list will appear with the duplicate titles listed.  Realize that these titles are not related to one another and that this Plugin only shows you the most recent article posted with that title. Say you have Article A that was originally posted on March 21st.
This Plugin lists Article B that was uploaded on May 16th with the same title.

6.To momentarily remove the duplicate page or post, highlight it (or all of them, depending) and find the dropdown menu in the left hand corner above the list and choose Move to Trash.  THIS WILL NOT DELETE THE POST PERMANENTLY.  It merely removes it from visibility so the necessary changes can be made.

7.To change the title, go back into Word Press, edit, save, and return to the plug in.

8.In the same drop down menu that Move to Trash was in, find Restore from Trash and click it.  This will make the article visible on the website again with the changes that have been made.

Thats it!  You have easily and successfully identified and removed your duplicate post and page titles!
